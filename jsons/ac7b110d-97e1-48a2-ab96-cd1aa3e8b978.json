    "description": "The most sensitive basins to warming are the watersheds that are near the current snowline “mixed rain and snow”. These are middle elevation basins that receive a mixture of rain and snow in the winter, and are projected to experience significant increases in winter flows and decreases in spring and summer flows as a result of warming.\n\nMore information about this analysis is available here:\nhttps://cig.uw.edu/resources/special-reports/ps-sok/\n",
