    "description": "These data were derived from the U.S. Climate Divisional Dataset, developed by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). NCEI provides long-term climate summaries for each of the country’s 344 climate divisions. Results for the “Puget Sound Lowlands (45-03)” climate division were used in the present analysis, which includes all of the low-lying land areas surrounding Puget Sound, where most of the historical weather observations are concentrated. For more information about this analysis please see http://cses.washington.edu/picea/mauger/ps-sok/ps-sok_sec12_builtenvironment_2015.pdf.
