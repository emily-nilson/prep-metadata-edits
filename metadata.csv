Information is collected from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor, and processed with a fire detection algorithm to flag active fires. Each dot on the map represents the center of a 375 meter pixel that has been flagged by the algorithm. The VIIRS data replaces the active fires data from MODIS that was previously available on Global Forest Watch. The VIIRS data has higher spatial resolution (375-meter pixels vs. 1-kilometer pixels) which improves detection of smaller fires and provides a more reliable estimate of fire perimeters. The VIIRS data is also better calibrated to detect fires at night. The active fires data is available to view and download for the past 24 hours, 48 hours, or 7 days. Older fire data will be available for download from the NASA FIRMS website beginning in mid-2016. Each fire alert has a confidence value of low, nominal, or high to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot /fire pixels.","U.S. Government Work","NASA","","https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data","","NASA VIIRS Active Fire Data",20cc5eca-8c63-4c41-8e8e-134dcf1e6d76

"Brightness Temperature (HIRS Channel 12) -- Global","187","","","Among the twenty channels in the HIRS instrument, channel 12 measures upper tropospheric water vapor (UTWV). Multiple polar orbiting satellites in the NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) series and MetOp-A have carried HIRS instruments. Due to the independence in calibration of the individual HIRS instruments, biases exist between satellites. Examination of the intersatellite biases shows that the biases are scene brightness temperature dependent. These HIRS channel 12 measurements from the NOAA POES and MetOp-A are calibrated to a baseline satellite based on intersatellite bias correction data. The differences from the last version include that the dataset is now provided as monthly mean 2.5x2.5 degree latitude/longitude in netcdf format and the time series has been extended to the end of 2013.

Historical data are generally available for 1929 to the present, with data from 1973 to the present being the most complete. For some periods, one or more countries' data may not be available due to data restrictions or communications problems. In deriving the summary of day data, a minimum of 4 observations for the day must be present (allows for stations which report 4 synoptic observations/day). Since the data are converted to constant units (e.g, knots), slight rounding error from the originally reported values may occur (e.g, 9.9 instead of 10.0). The mean daily values described below are based on the hours of operation for the station. For some stations/countries, the visibility will sometimes 'cluster' around a value (such as 10 miles) due to the practice of not reporting visibilities greater than certain distances. The daily extremes and totals--maximum wind gust, precipitation amount, and snow depth--will only appear if the station reports the data sufficiently to provide a valid value. Therefore, these three elements will appear less frequently than other values. Also, these elements are derived from the stations' reports during the day, and may comprise a 24-hour period which includes a portion of the previous day.
