In 2002 and in response to mounting requests for digital maritime zones, NOAA launched a project to re-evaluate the U.S. baseline in partnership with other federal agencies via the U.S. Baseline Committee. The focus of the baseline evaluation was NOAA's largest scale, most recent edition nautical charts as well as supplemental source materials for verification of certain charted features. This dataset is a result of the 2002-present initiative and reflects a multi-year iterative project whereby the baseline and associated maritime limits were re-evaluated on a state or regional basis.

Historical data are generally available for 1929 to the present, with data from 1973 to the present being the most complete. For some periods, one or more countries' data may not be available due to data restrictions or communications problems. In deriving the summary of day data, a minimum of 4 observations for the day must be present (allows for stations which report 4 synoptic observations/day). Since the data are converted to constant units (e.g, knots), slight rounding error from the originally reported values may occur (e.g, 9.9 instead of 10.0). The mean daily values described below are based on the hours of operation for the station. For some stations/countries, the visibility will sometimes 'cluster' around a value (such as 10 miles) due to the practice of not reporting visibilities greater than certain distances. The daily extremes and totals--maximum wind gust, precipitation amount, and snow depth--will only appear if the station reports the data sufficiently to provide a valid value. Therefore, these three elements will appear less frequently than other values. Also, these elements are derived from the stations' reports during the day, and may comprise a 24-hour period which includes a portion of the previous day.

Information is collected from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor, and processed with a fire detection algorithm to flag active fires. Each dot on the map represents the center of a 375 meter pixel that has been flagged by the algorithm. The VIIRS data replaces the active fires data from MODIS that was previously available on Global Forest Watch. The VIIRS data has higher spatial resolution (375-meter pixels vs. 1-kilometer pixels) which improves detection of smaller fires and provides a more reliable estimate of fire perimeters. The VIIRS data is also better calibrated to detect fires at night. The active fires data is available to view and download for the past 24 hours, 48 hours, or 7 days. Older fire data will be available for download from the NASA FIRMS website beginning in mid-2016. Each fire alert has a confidence value of low, nominal, or high to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot /fire pixels.","license":"U.S. Government Work","organization":"NASA","organization-long":"","short-description":"","subtitle":"NASA VIIRS Active Fire Data","source":"https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data"}

Eleven climatologists from the partner organizations take turns serving as the lead author each week.
